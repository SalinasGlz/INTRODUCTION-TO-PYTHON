    "His story begins in the late 80s and early 90s with Guido Van Rossum, during Christmas 1989, he worked at the CWI, a Dutch research center where he decided to start a project, giving continuity to ABC, a language that It was based on Basic, this programming language was developed in the same research center. The project did not transcend because the hardware was very outdated at the time. So Guido gave him a second chance and created Python, which his name comes from a comedy group that he really liked called Monty Python. So he published the first version of Python in 1991, which was version 0.9.0 alt.sources. In this version we already had classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions and modular types available. By 1994 he created comp.lang. Python, a Python discussion forum that doubled its number of users, and in this same year it reached version 1.0 which included new tools for programming. Then he released the latest version 1.2 on CWI. \n",

    "![CWI](https://www.paradigmadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lenguajes-programacion-Python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, in 1995, Guido worked at the Corporation for national research initiatives. And in the year 2000, the main Python team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen Python Labs team and in this same year version 1.6 and 2.0 came out. Python 2.0 includes list generation, one of the most important features of the Haskell functional programming language. I also include a garbage collection system capable of collecting cyclic references. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation was created which, based on Python 2.1 owns all code documentation and language specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LINE_TIME](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/PythonTimeline_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally in 2008 the last major update to Python 3.0 was released designed to rectify fundamental flaws in the language design. Python versions 2.X and 3.X were created to coexist for the various relays that were released in parallel and this is because Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 were released at the same time, but they are incompatible in several respects and therefore are they keep both active."
